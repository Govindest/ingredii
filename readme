# Ingredii

Simple pantry inventory management example built with SwiftUI.

This repository also contains an optional computer vision example that uses an
ESP32-CAM and TensorFlow Lite models to automatically identify pantry items or
scan text from a product label.

## Features

- Display a list of pantry items
- View item details
- Add and delete items
- Add items with optional expiry dates
- Data is persisted using `UserDefaults`
- Sample inventory is loaded on first launch using bundled JSON

## Running

Open `Ingredii/Ingredii.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the `Ingredii` target.

## Tests

Unit tests reside in the `IngrediiTests` group. Run them from Xcode via the `Product` → `Test` menu.

## Computer Vision Example

The `ArduinoCVBlynk` directory contains a companion project demonstrating how
to capture images from an ESP32‑CAM and classify them on-device. It uses two
TensorFlow Lite models:

1. **On-Device Food Classifier** – recognizes dozens of common dishes and
   snacks.
2. **ML Kit Text Recognition v2** – reads printed text from the image when
   invoked in `mode=ocr`.

See `ArduinoCVBlynk/README.md` for setup instructions.
